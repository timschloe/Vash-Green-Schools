Outreach, Advocacy,

----------------
Project Management Tool Public Access (cloud.vashgreenschools.org) (background docs here)
  

Key Goals of the Cloud Backend:
- Enable Project Management, in particular on-boarding of other activists & controls by Vash
- Allow full transparency by photo & video documentation of the project activities (ideally directly on a map).
- Transparent financial accounts.
- Record keeping of contacts to schools to allow for "1-year-later" follow ups.

=> Workflow for adding more activists & schools must become super simple and straight forward on the backend, as there are a total of 25'000 schools in Uganda and most of them need solar & stove.
